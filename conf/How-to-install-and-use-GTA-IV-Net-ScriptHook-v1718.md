To use a script, you need to copy it into your scripts folder, which is located inside your GTAIV or EFLC main folder. The script should have a .cs or .vb extension, depending on the language it was written in.
 
To activate a script, you need to press a certain key combination while in game. The default key combination is Ctrl+N, but you can change it in the ScriptHook.ini file, which is also located in your GTAIV or EFLC main folder.
