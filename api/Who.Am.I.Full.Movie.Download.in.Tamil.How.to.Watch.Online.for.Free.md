## Who Am I Full Movie Review: A Gripping and Stylish Thriller
 
Who Am I is not your typical hacker movie. It is not about hacking into banks or government agencies, but about hacking into people's minds and identities. The film explores the themes of anonymity, identity, and belonging in the digital age, and how they affect the characters' motivations and actions.
 
The film follows Benjamin (Tom Schilling), a socially awkward and insecure hacker who joins a group of rebellious hackers called CLAY (Clowns Laughing @ You). Together, they pull off daring cyberattacks that expose the corruption and hypocrisy of the powerful. However, things take a dark turn when they hack into the German secret service and attract the attention of a ruthless killer (Trine Dyrholm) who is determined to eliminate them.
 
The film is fast-paced and suspenseful, with twists and turns that keep you guessing until the end. The film also has a stylish and sleek visual aesthetic, with neon colors and glitch effects that create a contrast between the real and the virtual worlds. The film also features a catchy and pulsating soundtrack that matches the mood and tone of the scenes.
 
The film also boasts a strong cast of actors who deliver convincing and nuanced performances. Tom Schilling is excellent as Benjamin, who undergoes a transformation from a shy and lonely nerd to a confident and charismatic leader. Elyas M'Barek is charming as Max, Benjamin's charismatic and reckless friend who introduces him to the hacker world. Wotan Wilke MÃ¶hring is sympathetic as Stephan, Benjamin's mentor and father figure who has a tragic past. Antoine Monot Jr. is hilarious as Paul, Benjamin's loyal and quirky friend who provides comic relief. And Trine Dyrholm is terrifying as Hanne Lindberg, the cold-blooded and ruthless killer who hunts them down.
 
Who Am I is a gripping and stylish thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is a film that will make you think about your own identity and anonymity in the digital age, and how they can be used for good or evil. If you are looking for a thrilling and action-packed movie to watch, you should definitely check out Who Am I.
